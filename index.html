                <h3>About Me</h3><br>
                <p><b>My name is Yavier A. Mari Rodríguez and I'm a third year Student of Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus (UPRM). Since I was a child I've always had a passion for videogames, and one day aspire to be a developer myself. My current interests are League of Legends (Riot Games), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo), Heroes of Hammerwatch (Crackshell), Hamilton: The Musical (Lin-Manuel Miranda), and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (Nicalis, Inc.).</b></p>

                <h3>My Experiences</h3><br>
                <p><b>As mentioned before, I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at UPRM. I've worked on projects within my courses, along with being part of the IEEE Computer Society Web Development Team. As far as projects go, I've worked most of them at my Data Structures course, where we were given three videogame projects along the semester. We first were assigned a parody version of the arcade game Frogger, in which we were assigned to fulfill specs missing from the game, such as adding missing obstacles, implementing the map boundaries, correctly adding score and making sure a "Game Over" was obtainable. For the second project, an original videogame called Project: Envy was assigned, and RPG inspired game. For this one we also had to add different missing aspects, such as a quest system, an Non-Playable Character (NPC) with conditional dialogue, and obstacles to prevent the player from getting to the next area unless the quest was completed. As for the last project, a parody version of the Mario Maker videogame, where we were assigned to enable multiplayer in multiple screens, both characters with their individual focused camera, as well as adding new building blocks for the integrated map building interface. If any of these projects pique your interest, feel free to check them out in my Github down below.</b></p>
