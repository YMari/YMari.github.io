                <h3>About Me</h3><br>
                <p><b>My name is Yavier A. Mari Rodríguez and I'm a fourth year Student of Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus (UPRM). Since I was a child I've always had a passion for videogames, and one day aspire to be a developer myself. My current interests are League of Legends (Riot Games), The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo), Heroes of Hammerwatch (Crackshell), and The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (Nicalis, Inc.). As of recently, I also started making Voxel 3D Models in MagicaVoxel whenever I have free time, which has been pretty great. My creations are not available to the public yet but maybe I'll link them if I'm proud of them!</b></p>

                <h3>My Experiences</h3><br>
                <p><b>As mentioned above, I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at UPRM. As far as experiences go, most of my projects have been worked on during CSE related courses, especially during the Advanced Programming course and the Data Structures course, mostly using Java. Apart from these courses, I've also worked for the IEEE Computer Society Web Development Team for two different semesters, with goals to create websites for the IEEE.</br></br> During Advanced Programming, we did a variety of videogame related team projects in Java, including a parody of Frogger (we added features and fixed broken requirements), a parody RPG called Project:Envy (we added interactive NPC with a quest system and modified the world map), and lastly a parody of Super Mario Maker (we implemented new blocks for the editor, a new default map, new enemies, and a multiplayer feature). During Data Structures, I worked on a simulated Car Dealer program, using ADT's like Circular Sorted Doubly Linked Lists and Hash Tables, and implementing a REST API in it. As for my work with the IEEE Computer Society, it was mostly a learning group for website creation, so a final website was never released, partly because of Covid-19 quarantine and all that. Finally, during my Introduction to Software Engineering course, I worked with a team of students to create Flovver, an application designed to help women monitor their menstrual cycles. Most of the work I did here were software documentation and frontend development using TypeScript, along with designing the interface of the application with the team.</br></br> If any of these projects piqued your interest, feel free to check them out in my GitHub down below.</b></p>
